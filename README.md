# As soon as user signs up for the first time, shoot a welcome to the newly registered user.
# After the user changes the profile image, the change must be reflected in the main form and left sidebar.
# If user is logged out, the `No more posts` text is not displayed properly.
# In the follow suggestion users, if I follow a user, the button label is changed from `Follow` to `Following`, but when I again click on the button, it is calling the follow action once again.
