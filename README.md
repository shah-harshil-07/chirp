# In the post's text display, whenever there is a link, apply "span-link" CSS class on it and display it in that way. For e.g whenever there is a link of any kind in the post's text, that link portion must be colored in blue and decorated with an underline.
# In the repost editor, when the user reposts an image-wala post, the images are not properly shown in the repost body. Same goes for the post list's repost body content.
# After reposting any post or comment, the count of the reposted entity must be immediately updated.
# In reply box, the logged in user's image must appear and not the post creators'.
